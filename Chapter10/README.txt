This is the source code for the imwizard application demonstrated in
Chapter 10 of my book ImageMagick, the Definitive Guide. This is a
small Ruby script which demonstrates how to build an interactive
program which builds a list of commands to apply to images, and then
applies those commands to many images as specified by a regular
expression.  For more information about the book, see 
http://www.stillhq.com/imagemagick/book/

No installation is needed, so long as Ruby is installed on your
machine. It is possible you may need to tweak the path to Ruby in the
first line of the script however.

Let me know if you have more questions.
