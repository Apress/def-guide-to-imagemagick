This is the source code for the PHP sample described in Chapter 11 of my 
book ImageMagick, the Definitive Guide. The code uses stock images and a
background image to draw pretty graphs for a fictional home leasing site
which uses PHP. Using the PHP code should be as simple as installing the
ImageMagick PHP module, and then putting the file on a web server which
supports PHP. For more information about the book, see

Let me know if you have more questions.
