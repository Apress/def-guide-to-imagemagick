This is the source code for the Photomagick sample application from
my book ImageMagick, the Definitive Guide. The code uses ImageMagick
to implement a photo management system, with the main goal of
publishing images on web sites. More information about the code can
by found in the book, for which there is a website at
http://www.stillhq.com/imagemagick/book/

To install the code, edit the configuration items at the start of each
source code file. The photomagick.pl and PhotoMagick.pm files also
need to be in a directory which is accessible to a web server. This
will vary based on the web server you are using.

Let me know if you have more questions.
