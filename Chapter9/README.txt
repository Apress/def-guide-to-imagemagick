This is the source code for the the sample ImageMagick delegate
described in Chapter 9 of my book ImageMagick, the Definitive Guide.
The code is called by ImageMagick when a new file format is used.
The file format needs to be registered in the ImageMagick delegates.xml
file, as described in the chapter. For more information about the book,
see http://www.stillhq.com/imagemagick/book/

Let me know if you have more questions.
