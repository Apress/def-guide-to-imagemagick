There are four sample applications for ImageMagick, the Definitive Guide.
They are:

Chapter 8's Perl based photo publishing application
Chapter 9's C based ImageMagick delegate which implements a new file format
Chapter 10's Ruby based image batch processing front end
Chapter 11's PHP based dynamic graphing sample

Each subdirectory contains a README file which explains a little about that
application, and describes how to get it working.
